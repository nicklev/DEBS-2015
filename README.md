# DEBS-2015
The ACM DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge is the fifth in a series of challenges which seek to provide a common ground and evaluation criteria for a competition aimed at both research and industrial event-based systems. The goal of the 2015 DEBS Grand Challenge competition is to evaluate event-based systems in the context of real-time analytics over high volume geospatial data streams. The underlying scenario addresses the analysis of taxi trips based on a stream of trip reports from New York City. Specifically, the 2015 Grand Challenge targets following problems: the identification of recent frequent routes and identification of high profit regions. The corresponding queries demand the analysis of taxi location data along with other trip meta-data.

The data for the 2015 Grand Challenge is based on a data set released under the FOIL (The Freedom of Information Law) and made public by Chris Whong (http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/). Details about the data, the queries for the DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge, and information about how the challenge will be evaluated is provided below.
